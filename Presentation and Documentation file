# Oier Aguirre Rua - Official Website
## What is this project?
- Tis project is a personal and proffesional website, which gathers some of the work of my music portfolio

## Why this project?
- I believe that having a website is essential because it allows you to showcase your work, connect with a global audience, and establish your professional presence in an accessible and reliable way.
- It is also good for me to have everything in the same place gathered, instead of having my work just somewhere in my computer. People can also see that I am multifacetic in some way, and this is a good way to show it and show my work.
- It is a first step towards creating a much better website. I also coded everything myself, which makes me a bit proud.
- If someone asks me what I do, this is a good way to summarize it.

## Inpirations and Resources
### Inspirations
- Singer: Dani Fernández's new album webpage. [Dani_Fernández_LaJauría](https://danifernandezoficial.es)
- Producer: Rafa Sarfina. [Rafa_Sardina_Webpage](https://rafasardina.com)
- Singer: Pablo Alborán. [Pablo_Alborán_Webpage](https://www.pabloalboran.es/?frontpage=true)


### Resources
- This individual called Dani Krossing helped me a lot in understanding how the basics of html work and the process to follow.[HTML_for_Begginers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8jDnBYc0bs&list=PL0eyrZgxdwhwP0AxnbBiDBCi53LK9uCMZ)

## How does it work? 
- Looks easy but is more difficult than it seams. Everything needs a line of code
- Every section has its own HTML and CSS file (It is possible to combine the css in one, but much better structured this way)

## Process:
- Research and understanding everything
- Thinking about outline
- Coding (and debbuging)

### Navigation Tab
- I implemented the navigation tab in every HTML file, so that it stays the same.
- Let´s look at it![index.html](https://github.com/OierAguirreRua/oieraguirrerua.github.io/blob/main/index.html)

- Structure:
    - Type: HTML
    - Language: EN

    - 2 main sections:
        - Head
            - Some HTML presets
            - Little Icon on Tab. I asked ChatGPT to make me a simple one.
            - Reset Style Sheet
                - Resets the presets each browser has, so that you can style everything as wanted (removes margins)
        - Body
