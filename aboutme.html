    <h1>Meet Oier!</h1>
    <h2><p>Oier Aguirre Rua is a 20 year old singer-songwriter born in the Basque Country, Spain. Starting his music path at the age of 7 years old, Oier has been involved in a great variety of music styles ranging from classical music to Pop, Singer-Songwriter, R&B or Electronic music, among others.</p><br>

        <p>His passion for singing begun at a really young age, often performing songs from his favorite TV shows for his family.  His formal music education started when he became a classical percussionist and learned piano at his hometown conservatory. At 10, Oier joined the prestigious international youth choir, "Kantika Korala," embarking on tours across countries like France, Portugal, Italy, and Israel. Over the next eight years, he participated in international choir festivals, winning first prizes in categories like Folk, Children’s, and the Grand Prix at the "Rimini International Choral Competition - 2017" in Italy, as well as the top prize at Spain’s national "Certamen Coral de Avilés" competition.</p><br>
        
        <p>Despite his classical background, Oier's passion for singing inspired him to start writing his own songs at 14, along with uploading cover songs to YouTube. This sparked his desire to pursue music further, leading him to attend Berklee College of Music in Boston, where he currently studies Electronic Production and Design, as well as Film and Media Scoring. Oier is also currently working on his next release and his goal is to evoke emotions through his songs while breaking down both musical and cultural barriers.</p></h2>
